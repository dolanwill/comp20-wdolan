This is the ReadMe for Lab 7, the Captain's Log

The Log application has been implemented correctly; the messages submitted with the input box display themsleves in the order in which they were submitted, acheived with a prepend function in the javascript. When the page is refreshed, or closed, the local storage does not display the messages in the order in which they came, but it does display them alphabetically by date submitted.

I spent about 2 or 3 hours on the assignment, and collaborated with Jake Caccamo for quite a bit of it. This consisted of us learning how to use jquery syntax and helping each other with conceptual ideas.
