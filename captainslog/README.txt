This is the ReadMe for Lab 7, the Captain's Log
****PLEASE NOTE*****
I had a lot of technical difficulty getting the local directory to sync to the master repository on the github page. I believe it was due to syntactical errors when carrying out the git initialization commands. The result was me constantly pushing to a nonexistant repository, and while locally the file was being edited and I was pushing with commit messages, I failed to notice that the master branch on github wasn't updated.

Essentially, I made about 20 add/commit/push commands throughout the process of making the program, but none of them regiestered, and I've only just set up the master branch/local directory properly now that my program is done and finished. This will probably seem like a complete lack of pushing/commit messages, but I assure you this wasn't the case, and I hope you understand.

The Captian's Log application has been implemented correctly; the messages submitted with the input box display themsleves in the order in which they were submitted, acheived with a prepend function in the javascript. When the page is refreshed, or closed, the local storage does not display the messages in the order in which they came, but it does display them alphabetically by date submitted.

I spent about 2 or 3 hours on the assignment, and collaborated with Jake Caccamo for quite a bit of it. This consisted of us learning how to use jquery syntax and helping each other with conceptual ideas.
