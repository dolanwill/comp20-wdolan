Lab 4 Readme

This is the readme for Lab 4, the responsive lab. In this repository are the unchanged HTML code provided to us, the picture provided to us, and the responsive.css file.  I tested it in Chrome, and it works fine, after some toying with zooming in and out.

I worked alone on this assignment, and it probably took about an hour or an hour and a half. Most of my time was spent setting up the git folder and messing around with that.
