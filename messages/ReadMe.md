Lab6 ReadMe

This is the ReadMe for Lab6, the Messages Lab. 
The files all work(ed) correctly. The implementation had full funcitonality when the data.json file was in the  same domain as the the lab.js file.

Once the domain of the XMLHttpRequest's requested file was changed to something different, then the script stopped working. This is in line with the principle of the Same Origin Policy. A particular website cannot access files or other data from extraneous domains, for secutity issues.

If one were to change the second parameter of the 
request.open function back to data.json, the program would work again.

I didn't collaborate on this assignment, and worked for about 2 hours.
