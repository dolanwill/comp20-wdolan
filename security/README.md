Assignment 4 Readme

This is the Readme for Assignemtn 4, the security evaluation of Lucas Johnson's server implementation for the Marauder's Map.

The assignment was successful, in that there were defeinitely reportable security flaws. Some were major and including code injection, either through malicious and deviant user input, or by code injection into the databse queries. Others were less severe and consisted of coding malpractices.

All in all I worked alone on this assignment, probably for about 4 or so hours.
