Marauder's Map

This is the ReadMe for Assignment 2, the Marauder's Map.

All in all, the project was a big success. It took me a long time (I probably spent about 12-15 hours on this, it really took me a while to get used to working with APIs), but everything turned out the way I wanted it to, all the way down to icon scaling and clearing the windows when a new one was clicked. 

I didn't collaborate with anyone in the class, but drew heavily from the Ming's example, the Google Maps API tutorial, and the material/syntax we discussed in class.

As I said, there is no functionality that doesn't work as intended. The JSON, Maps, and geolocator API's are all integrated as  I would hope them to be.
